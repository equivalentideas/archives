# What do records do in peoples lives that nothing else does?

They form and shape our identities in public and private spheres.

Negotiating public/private domain issues around records is one of the particular professional challenges for archivists. Calls for mass digitisation and openness need to be tempered against complex, contested and dynamic rights and responsibilities. 

## What are these complex, contested and dynamic rights and responsibilities?

## Background

*[To be written up](https://github.com/equivalentideas/archives/edit/master/README.md)*

The idea for this scratch pad git repo came from the [‘Improving access to archives and other records’ – Melbourne edition](http://rkroundtable.org/2014/09/24/what-do-records-do-in-peoples-lives-that-nothing-else-does/).
